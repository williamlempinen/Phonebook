# Phonebook

My first fullstack project! This is my school project that I have made on our Web Programming -course in University of Turku. This project is build with the MERN-stack (mongo, express, react and node).

In this project you can write your name and number, and save it to the database. If your name or number doesn't fullfill the established criterias, the browser will show an alert message. You can also delete contacts of your choice.
